## :question: About

During the"Old Stone Age" period, early humans lived in caves or simple huts or tepees and were hunters and gatherers. They used basic stone and bone tools, for hunting birds and wild animals. They also fished and collected berries, plants, herbs fruit and nuts…really anything they could…these guys were not on any kind of trendy Paleo diet…they needed the nutrients to survive the harsh living conditions of this time.\
\
We believe most likely many humans from this era made the fatal mistake of not properly identifying a poisonous plant, herb or berry.
With this application we will be saving lives and tepee toilets by giving our users an application that allows them to:
- Properly identify your plant source via an image
- Identify species, common name and family of the plant
- Determine if the plant is toxic or not.
